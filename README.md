# Credit-card-fraud
This dataset is taken from Kaggle.
I have used various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. 
In the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons.
Only thing we know is those columns that are unknown and have been scaled already.
The transaction amount is relatively small.
The mean of all the amounts made is approximately USD 88. 
There are no "Null" values, so no need to work on ways to replace values. 
Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%), while Fraud transactions occurs (0.17%) in the data frame.
